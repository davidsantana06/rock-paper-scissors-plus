**Rock Paper Scissors Plus** is a Java console application featuring three versions of the classic game: the traditional Classic with 3 gestures, the extended RPS-9 with 9, and the popular Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock with 5.

It uses a modular architecture based on the **Service Provider Interface (SPI)**, allowing easy addition of new variants while keeping a consistent terminal interface and gameplay.
